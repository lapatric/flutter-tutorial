## Flutter Installation

To install Flutter, follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). In our case, we install it on a macOS device and will be using the iOS simulator provided by XCode - as explained in the aformentioned guide. A new flutter project is then created as follows:

```bash
# create new flutter app
flutter create my_app
cd my_app
# run app in simulator
flutter run 
```
