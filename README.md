This is repo follows along with the follow 1 hour Flutter tutorial on youtube: https://youtu.be/C-fKAzdTrLU


## Flutter Installation

To install Flutter, follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). In our case, we install it on a macOS device and will be using the iOS simulator provided by XCode - as explained in the aformentioned guide. A new flutter project is then created as follows:

```bash
# create new flutter app
flutter create my_app
```


## VSCode extensions

To greately increase the development speed, we install the [Awesome Flutter Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nash.awesome-flutter-snippets) tool. This allows for quick auto-completes of many absic code snippets in Flutter. Furthermore, we install the [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension.


## Emulator

To run the application in an Android or iOS emulator. Simply hit `Cmd+P` and type `Flutter: Launch Emulator`. This will provide you with the option to launch the latest Android or iOS device as an emulator. Then hit the play button in the VSCode editor to run the application.

## Documentation

The [Flutter documenation](https://docs.flutter.dev) is a good place to start when you don't know how to implement something.
