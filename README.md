This is repo follows along with the follow 1 hour Flutter tutorial on youtube: https://youtu.be/C-fKAzdTrLU

## Flutter Installation

To install Flutter, follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). In our case, we install it on a macOS device and will be using the iOS simulator provided by XCode - as explained in the aformentioned guide. A new flutter project is then created as follows:

```bash
# create new flutter app
flutter create my_app
cd my_app
# run app in simulator
flutter run 
```

## VSCode extensions

To greately increase the development speed, we install the [Awesome Flutter Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nash.awesome-flutter-snippets) tool. Which allows for quick auto-completes of many absic code snippets in Flutter.
